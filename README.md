# Song-Recommender
Created a small website that allowed users to login with Spotify and get song recommendations based on their liked songs.
Built and hosted a neural net based song recommendation engine using Tensorflow.

Model was trained using Spotify's million playlist dataset.
Used Spotify's dataset to augment dataset to be more feature-rich.
Used Spotify's API for retrieval and then used a DNN to rerank.

Created as a project submission for a master's level information retrieval course.
A more detailed description can be found in caparson_project.pdf, the writeup submitted for the course.
The recommendation service is no longer online since the lab server that once hosted the recommendation engine is now in use for other projects.
